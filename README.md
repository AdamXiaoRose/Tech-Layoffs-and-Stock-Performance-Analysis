# Tech Layoffs and Stock Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

This project investigates the impact of layoffs in technology companies on their stock performance. By collecting and analyzing data on company layoffs and stock prices, we aim to uncover patterns and correlations that can inform stakeholders about the financial implications of workforce reductions.

## Repository Structure

- `Company_list (1).xls`: List of technology companies considered in the analysis.
- `layoff data.csv`: Dataset containing information on layoffs, including dates, number of employees affected, and associated companies.
- `layoff data with city lat and lng.xls`: Enhanced layoff dataset with geographic coordinates of affected cities.
- `Regression models and visualization.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook detailing regression analyses and visualizations of the data.
- `Stock price data getting.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for retrieving and processing stock price data for the companies in question.
- `Stock_price_trends.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook analyzing trends in stock prices relative to layoff events.
- `visualization version II.ipynb`: Updated visualizations and analyses based on refined data.
- `对回归结果的简单解释.docx`: Document providing a simple explanation of the regression results (in Chinese).
- `获取数据的一些记录.docx`: Notes on data acquisition processes (in Chinese).

## Key Findings

- **Immediate Market Reaction**: Preliminary analyses suggest that layoff announcements often lead to a short-term decline in stock prices, reflecting negative investor sentiment.
- **Long-Term Trends**: In some cases, companies that implemented layoffs showed stock price recovery over the long term, potentially due to improved operational efficiencies.
- **Geographic Factors**: The geographic distribution of layoffs indicates potential regional economic impacts, with certain tech hubs experiencing higher layoff rates.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Compiled a list of major technology companies.
   - Gathered layoff data from public sources, including the number of employees affected and dates.
   - Retrieved historical stock price data for each company around the time of layoff announcements.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Conducted regression analyses to assess the relationship between layoff events and stock price movements.
   - Visualized data to identify patterns and anomalies.
   - Analyzed geographic data to explore regional impacts of layoffs.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Replication**: Users can replicate the analyses by running the Jupyter Notebooks provided. Ensure that all necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib) are installed.
- **Data Exploration**: The datasets can be used to explore additional questions related to layoffs and stock performance.
- **Further Research**: This analysis can serve as a foundation for more detailed studies on the economic implications of workforce reductions in the tech industry.

## Future Work

- **Expand Dataset**: Incorporate more companies and a longer time frame to enhance the robustness of the analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze news articles and social media to gauge public and investor sentiment surrounding layoff events.
- **Financial Metrics**: Examine other financial indicators, such as revenue and profit margins, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of layoffs.
